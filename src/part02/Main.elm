    elm-graphql SelectionSets: A group of 0 or more Fields.

    (?) How do {Code|elm-graphql} {Code|SelectionSet}s differ from GraphQL Selection Sets?


If a Field is a primitive type (like the {Code|randomQuote} field which had type {Code|String!}), then it's a leaf. But some Fields return {Code|Objects} instead of data. In these cases, we need to say which fields to get from that Object. In other words, we need to pass in a nested {Code|SelectionSet}.

As in the last exercise, we start out with {Code|SelectionSet.empty}.

| List
    -> Replace {Code|Query.randomQuote} with a Query calling {Code|allPackages}. Use {Code|SelectionSet.empty} for the nested {Code|SelectionSet}.
    (?) What use might {Code|SelectionSet.empty} have in a real-world project?
    (?) How do the type signatures compare for the top-level query and the nested selection?
    (?) What would fetching books look like in a REST API?


Now let's specify the details we want for each Elm {Code|Package}.


| List
    -> Instead of {Code|SelectionSet.empty}, get the {Code|title} of each {Code|Package}.


Taking tiny steps is essential to moving quickly and building up maintainable code. We want to fetch more than just the Package's {Code|title}. But in order to take the quickest path to the */next compiling state/*, our first step fetching one Field is a great start.
