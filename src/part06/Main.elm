| Header
    Method 1: Map<n + 1>


| List
    -> Pick a new field to add to the {Code|currentWeather} selection. Change the {Code|CurrentWeather} alias first. Look up the type of the field you're going to add and use that information to change the record alias.
    -> Add one more piece of data from the {Code|currentWeather} to your request by turning {Code|map5} into a {Code|map6}.
    (?) How was the experience of finding the field's type? What other ways could you look it up?


| Header
    Method 2: Pipelines

| List
    -> Convert the current {Code|map6} into a pipeline.
    -> Add one more field to the pipeline.


| Header
    Error Messages

| List
    -> Duplicate the {Code|weatherSelection} under a different name. Change the copied code to use a {Code|map6} so you can see them side-by-side.
    (?) How do the two versions compare?
    -> Cause an error in both the original and the duplicate by changing the types within your {Code|CurrentWeather} type alias definition. Try changing {Code|temperature: Float} to {Code|temperature: String}.
    (?) How do the messages themselves differ?
    (?) Do the error messages point to different lines of code? If so, why?
