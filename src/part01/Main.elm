| List
    -> What happens if you delete {Code|__typename} in the GraphQL query pane?
    (?) How is the data returned different in the {Code|elm-graphql} response and the {Code|gql} response? Why?

| Header
    Find the Field

Let's turn this {Code|empty} query into something a bit more interesting!

| List
    (?) There is exactly one top-level value you can get without doing any nested selection sets. Which is it? <> *Hint*: try exploring the {Code|< Docs} pane.
    -> Confirm your answer by making the query in the Graphiql editor above and checking that it is valid without a nested Selection Set.
    (?) Why do you need to nest selection sets for some, but not for this one?


| Header
    Can I Write Elm Code Now?

You've waited long enough! Let's build our first query in Elm!

| List
    (?) What do you expect to be the return type in your Elm code when you fetch this? Why?
    -> Now, modify {Code|Main.elm} to fetch the field described above. *Note:* the solution doesn't involve importing any new modules."""
