Let's use a new tool to turn our returned data into something meaningful. Instead of getting the raw data and then doing something with it, we often prefer to get the data into exactly the meaningful data structure we want with no intermediary format. This is exactly where mapping comes in!


| Blockquote
    SelectionSet.map takes a function and a SelectionSet and calls that function on whatever data comes back in that SelectionSet.

| List
    (?) Look at the type signature in the docs for {Code|SelectionSet.map}. What does it tell you?
    -> Using {Code|SelectionSet.map}, change the top-level {Code|SelectionSet} to give us the count of all packages. Note that the type of {Code|Response} will change {Code|Int} instead of a {Code|List ()}.

    More Complex Maps

Now let's forget about the package names for a second. I want to scan a list of the latest version numbers. So I want to see something like this:


| Monospace

    Success
    [
      "1.0.0"
      "2.0.3"
      "1.5.0"
      "4.5.2"
    ]

This map is a bit more challenging, so let's break it down into small steps. The smaller our steps, the faster we move.

| Blockquote
    Small steps: The smaller our steps, the faster we move.

First we'll do a hardcoded mapping. So instead of real data, turn every "latest version" into a hard coded "1.2.3".

| List
    -> Create a function which maps a versions argument of type {Code|List String} into a hard coded latest version of type {Code|String}. Apply this mapping to get a long list of "1.2.3" over and over again!
    -> Now, change the hard coded "1.2.3" in your return type to be the actual "latest published package version" (i.e. the last {Code|String} in the {Code|versions} list).
    (?) What would this code look like as a series of calls to {Code|SelectionSet.map}? Which format do you prefer?
    (?) What did the hard coded mapping step do for you? What are some benefits? When would you choose to use this intermediary step, when would you not?

| Header
    Mapping Into a Record

Now that we're getting the latest version of our packages, we'd like to get some other details, too! But we also want to practice taking *tiny steps*! Why? Because small steps is what let's us move quickly, steadily, and without mistakes! It might seem unnecessary now, but having this skill at your fingertips is what will make you a master Elm GraphQL query builder!

| List
    -> Change the {Code|type alias} for {Code|ElmStuff} to be a record with a *single field in it*. Hint: you'll need to use {Code|SelectionSet.map}.
    (?) What's the benefit of starting with this step before adding more fields to our {Code|ElmStuff} record alias?
